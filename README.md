## Some of the Projects Included 📚
- **Project 1: Hangman**
  - The Hangman game is a classic word guessing game where players try to guess the letters in a word within a certain number of attempts. It's a fun way to practice vocabulary and spelling. The game includes visual representations of the hangman stages and provides feedback on incorrect guesses, reducing the player's lives. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses all the letters in the word or runs out of lives.

- **Project 2: Password Generator**
  - The Password Generator is a Python program that creates a strong, random password based on user-specified criteria such as the number of letters, symbols, and numbers. It ensures a mix of different character types to enhance security and prevent easily guessable passwords. The generated password is displayed to the user at the end.

- **Project 3: Rock Paper Scissors**
  - The Rock Paper Scissors game is a simple Python program that lets you play the classic hand game against the computer. You can choose rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer will randomly select one as well. The program then compares the choices and determines the winner based on the standard rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

Treasure Island is a choice-based game where every decision you make determines your fate. Navigate through a mysterious castle filled with perilous traps and enchanted chambers.
